      "summary": "<p>This is a nice little game night for people to come by without VR and hangout while playing a fun game called \"SCP Secret Laboratory\". It is a completely free-to-play game that anyone can download from steam. I will be hosting my own private server that only members who want to join in can join in. This way, I can moderate a little easier and make sure people are comfortable to continue playing. This game is a fully PvP style game where players take turn playing either an SCP, either a Scientist or D-Class citizen trying to escape, or a facility guard who tries and helps both to escape. Since death happens a lot in the game, players also get to respawn as either MTF or Chaos Insurgency, which are military factions, to help players escape and contain the remaining SCPs. Each round lasts around 15-20 minutes on average. </p>\n<p><strong>Game:</strong> SCP: Secret Laboratory<br>https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/</p>\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong> Standard LPD rules apply. This is a private server, so players will need to directly connect to the server and cannot find it via the server browser. Anyone who wants to join will need to DM me to receive the address to directly connect to the server. People can play the game as they see fit and can have fun as long as they are adhering to the standard LPD rules.</p>",
